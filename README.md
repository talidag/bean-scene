This project showcases my journey in implementing a Figma design using React, focusing on advanced CSS techniques like absolute positioning. I create a well-organized project structure using Atomic Design principles.

Key Learnings:

* **Figma to Reality**: Translating Figma designs into a functional React application, mastering the art of pixel-perfect implementation. ([Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/6jd1Nz6aLld3kRX8aoBXfS/Bean-Scene-Coffee-Landingpage-(Community)?type=design&node-id=1-4&mode=design&t=O4UOG0QlzY1djTFS-0)) <br />
* **Position Absolute Mastery**: Gained proficiency in leveraging CSS absolute positioning for intricate layout arrangements and visual harmony. <br />
* **Atomic Design Structure**: Explored the benefits of Atomic Design by constructing reusable components at atomic levels, enhancing development efficiency.<br />

This repository reflects my growth in UI implementation, CSS finesse, and React structuring, providing a solid foundation for future projects.
